## Operators and Expressions
Unary, Binary, or Ternary depending on number of operands -- 1, 2, or 3.

Conditional ternary expressions are three-part expressions. Evaluates
to a single result. Works like a one-line IF-ELSE block

```
(Test_Expression) ? (Evaluated_If_True) : (Evaluated_If_False)
```

Unary operators (1 operand) include:
- Logical negation (!)
- Post-increment or -decrement (x++ or x--)
- Pre-increment or -decrement (++x or --x)
- Type casting operator (()x or (x))
    - `converted = (new_type)original;`

Operator precedence seems to be identical to C so far. Might want to look into
further.
